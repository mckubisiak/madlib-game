        <span>You think I'm an ignorant <span id="noun1">savage</span><br>
            And you've been so many places<br>
            I guess it must be so<br>
            But still I cannot see<br>
            If the <span id="noun2">savage one</span> is me<br>
            How can there be so much that you don't <span id="verb1">know</span><br>
            You don't know<br>
            You think you own whatever land you land on<br>
            The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim<br>
            But I know every rock and tree and creature<br>
            Has a life, has a spirit, has a name<br>
            You think the only people who are people<br>
            Are the people who look and think like you<br>
            But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger<br>
            You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew<br>
            Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br>
            Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned<br>
            Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains<br>
            Can you paint with all the colors of the wind<br>
            Can you paint with all the colors of the wind<br>
